Internship portfolio featuring Python-based data automation, Excel analytics tools, and KPI dashboards built in Zoho Analytics to enable faster, data-driven decisions.

Author: Aayush Kumbhar
Role: Data Analyst Intern

Overview
This repository showcases my work as a Data Analyst Intern (August–September 2025) at Mpower-Mind Matters, where I focused on automating data processes, building dashboards, and generating actionable business insights.
The projects here highlight my skills in Python-based data analysis, Excel automation, Zoho Analytics dashboards, and strategic reporting.

Key Contributions
1. Interactive KPI Dashboards (Zoho Analytics)
Designed and deployed dynamic dashboards in Zoho Analytics for real-time KPI tracking.
Enabled managers to make faster, data-driven decisions by visualizing sales, revenue, and performance metrics.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to define measurable success indicators.

2. Automated Month-to-Month Comparison Report Generator (Python)
Developed a Python-based automation tool to analyze monthly Excel data and generate professional Word reports automatically.
The script reads raw Excel files, detects data sections, and computes detailed statistics including:
Differences and percentage changes between months
Moving averages, ratios, medians, and standard deviations
Contextual insights based on growth or decline trends
Outputs a formatted Word document with clear section headings, bullet points, and insights for each performance indicator.
Built using pandas, python-docx, and math, eliminating manual data analysis and report writing.
Helped streamline monthly KPI reporting — reducing manual effort by over 60% and improving consistency and accuracy across reports.

Input: Excel file (e.g., MTC_MUMBAI.xlsx)
Output: Auto-generated Word report (e.g., Professional1_July_to_August_Comparison_Report.docx)

3. Data Cleaning and Transformation (Excel-based)
Cleaned and standardized large Excel-based business datasets using Python (pandas, openpyxl, numpy).
Automated detection and correction of missing, inconsistent, and outlier values to ensure data accuracy.
Transformed unstructured Excel sheets into analysis-ready formats for downstream visualization and reporting.
Improved data quality and reliability, directly enhancing the accuracy of automated monthly reports.

4. Growth Opportunity Research and Competitive Analysis
Researched and analyzed potential growth strategies to help expand Mpower Minds’ market presence.
Conducted competitive benchmarking by comparing Mpower Minds’ offerings, reach, and marketing strategies with key competitors.
Collected and evaluated data from various online sources to identify partnership and expansion opportunities.
Collaborated with the team to generate data-backed growth opportunity reports containing actionable recommendations.
